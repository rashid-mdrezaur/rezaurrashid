Adherence to scheduled radiation therapy (RT) is a key determinant of cancer treatment quality and outcomes. For this study, we developed an interpretable AI model to identify 1) patients at risk for multiple unplanned RT interruptions and 2) modifiable factors contributing to an elevated risk of RT interruption.
