In this paper, we introduce a novel causal feature selection (CFS) algorithm that leverages causal structure learning to identify a subset of causal features. Our approach involves employing a causal graph discovery method to represent the causal relationships among variables and the causal effects of features on the target variable. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed CFS algorithm, we introduce a new evaluation criterion based on causal metrics, offering a principled and rigorous approach to assess the performance of causal feature selection methods.
