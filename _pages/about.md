I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC), Memphis.

My research focuses on **AI-driven healthcare analytics**, including causal modeling, explainable AI, and social determinants of health (SDoH). I develop computational methods to understand and predict interruptions in cancer radiation therapy, and explore how machine learning can empower clinicians and improve outcomes, especially for underserved populations.

**Research Interests:**
- Causal inference & graph neural networks
- Explainable AI for clinical decision support
- Multimodal clinical & social data integration
- Health equity & SDoH
