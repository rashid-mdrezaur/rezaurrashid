I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** at the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://uthsc.edu/cbmi), Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, at the *University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC)* in Memphis, Tennessee, working under the mentorship of [**Dr. Arash Shaban-Nejad**](https://uthsc.edu/cbmi/about/faculty-staff.php). My work focuses on developing explainable, trustworthy, and data-driven AI frameworks for healthcare, with a particular emphasis on cancer outcomes and health disparities.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science (2024)** from the *University of North Carolina at Charlotte* in Charlotte, NC, advised by [**Dr. Gabriel Terejanu**](https://cci.charlotte.edu/directory/gabriel-terejanu/) in the Uncertainty Quantification Lab [(UQLab)](https://www.uncertaintyquantification.org/).  Before that, I received my **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering** in 2017 from *BRAC University*, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

My expertise includes causal inference and causal discovery, explainable AI (XAI), graph neural network (GNN)-based machine learning, and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and social applications. I integrate advanced advanced computational methods with high-impact domains, particularly in healthcare analytics, social determinants of health integration, and clinical decision support, while also bringing experience in business and decision analytics, social media dynamics and network analysis, and predictive modeling for complex, high-dimensional data.
