I am a **Postdoctoral Scholar** at the [Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI)](https://uthsc.edu/cbmi), Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, at the *University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC)* in Memphis, Tennessee, working under the mentorship of [**Dr. Arash Shaban-Nejad**](https://uthsc.edu/cbmi/about/faculty-staff.php). My work focuses on developing explainable, trustworthy, and data-driven AI frameworks for healthcare, with a particular emphasis on cancer outcomes and health disparities.

I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science (2024)** from the *University of North Carolina at Charlotte* in Charlotte, North Carolina, advised by [**Dr. Gabriel Terejanu**](https://cci.charlotte.edu/directory/gabriel-terejanu/) in the [Uncertainty Quantification Lab (UQLab)](https://www.uncertaintyquantification.org/).  Before that, I received my **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering** in 2017 from *BRAC University*, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

My expertise spans the design and application of AI systems that bridge methodological innovation with real-world impact. I specialize in causal inference and causal discovery, explainable AI (XAI), graph neural networks (GNNs), and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and social applications. I combine rigorous statistical reasoning with advanced machine learning models to create systems that are transparent, interpretable, and actionable. My work integrates multimodal data sources — from structured clinical records to unstructured social data — into robust, scalable pipelines, leveraging modern deep learning frameworks and high-performance computing environments. Beyond healthcare analytics and social determinants of health (SDoH) integration, I also bring experience in business and decision analytics, social media dynamics and network analysis, and predictive modeling for complex, high-dimensional systems.
