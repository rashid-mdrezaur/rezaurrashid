## Current Research

### AI-Driven Analytics for Radiation Therapy Interruptions
I develop interpretable AI models—including graph neural networks and causal inference pipelines—to identify and explain factors associated with unplanned interruptions in cancer radiation therapy, with a focus on underserved populations and integrating social determinants of health (SDoH).

### Empathic AI for Oncology Patient Support
My work explores the design and evaluation of LLM-powered synthetic personas to simulate empathic patient-provider dialogues, enabling digital health navigation, patient education, and assessment of AI readiness in healthcare.

### Sentiment Analysis in Maternal Health
I apply large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to analyze pregnancy weight gain discussions on social media, aiming to extract public health insights and improve maternal health support.
