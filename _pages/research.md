My research integrates **causal AI**, **explainable AI (XAI)**, **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, and **large language models (LLMs)** to address real-world challenges in healthcare, with a particular focus on cancer outcomes, health disparities, and causal discovery. I focus on building explainable, trustworthy, and data-driven AI frameworks for healthcare that are both clinically interpretable and technically rigorous, enabling healthcare stakeholders to act on insights that address not just symptoms but root causes.

## Current Research Projects
---

### Explainable AI for Radiation Therapy Interruptions
- Develop and validate an explainable AI-driven clinical decision support framework for predicting unplanned Radiation Therapy (RT) Interruptions. Incorporating explainable AI and causal modeling to identify key modifiable predictors and enable targeted clinical interventions.  


### Empathic AI for Oncology Patient Support
- Design and prototyping of an empathic AI assistant for oncology patients using synthetic personas generated by LLMs. This includes persona creation, dialogue simulation, and clinician-led evaluation of empathy in AI responses. The project integrates socio-demographic diversity, empathy cues, and clinical context into patient–AI conversations.

### Women’s Health Social-Media Sentiment & Peer-Support Analysis
- Analyzing large-scale Reddit datasets related to maternal health: pregnancy weight management, and peer-support communities using multi-model sentiment benchmarking (LLM-based + Transformer-based); conversation-cascade graph analysis to model sentiment flow and peer influence; topic modeling to assess sentiment shift depth and valuation of peer-support effectiveness.

### Off-Label Drug–Condition Relationship Prediction
- Developing causal inference and correlation-based frameworks for predicting candidate off-label uses for existing drugs, employing statistical association measures, semantic similarity, and neighborhood-based graph methods for candidate ranking.

### Modeling the "Why" in Business Operations (Lowe’s)
- Businesses collect vast amounts of data, which they leverage with advanced modeling techniques to develop actions to enhance their operations. The goal of this research is to create an AI engine that provides managers with actionable recommendations to produce a desired effect on key performance indicators, e.g. supply chain metrics. Open-Source Python Library: [Automated Feature Synthesis](https://bitbucket.org/uqlab/automated_feature_synthesis/src/master/); [Causal Feature Selection](https://bitbucket.org/uqlab/causal_feature_selection/src/master/).

### Causal Feature Selection (CFS) Algorithm
- Introduced a novel CFS algorithm and a causal evaluation framework to identify causally-relevant features for improved model interpretability and accuracy.  
- **Publication:** [IEEE DSAA 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10302608).

### Causal Pairs to Causal Graphs
- Proposed probabilistic approach leveraging cause-effect pairs for causal discovery to improve efficiency and scalability compared to traditional methods.  
- **Publication:** [IEEE ICMLA 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10069122).
